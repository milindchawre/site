My name is [Milind Chawre](https://milindchawre.github.io). I'm devops engineer based in [Pune, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune) - passionate about [cloud native technologies](https://landscape.cncf.io/) and anything related to [docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). I enjoy creating great products with great user experiences and loves working in a dynamic environment with a focus on good development practices, automation, frequent releases. I love building systems from scratch with best practices like security, automation, CI/CD, logging, monitoring, alerting, etc.
