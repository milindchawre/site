I passed the [AZ-104 exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104) today (1st June 2022) with a score of 915/1000. This exam tests your skills to implement, manage and monitor an organizationâ€™s azure environment.

I already had some experience with azure and have recently passed Azure fundamentals exam - [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900). Having hands on experience is better if you want to crack this exam.

It took me around a week to get fully prepared. I referred following resources for preparation:
- [Exam AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator, 2nd Edition by T. Ray Humphrey](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/exam-az-104-microsoft/9780137590001/) - It covers most of the syllabus for exam, explaining the concepts and focus areas.
- Pearson practice test for AZ-104 exam - it was available on oreilly learning, it contains 4 mock tests.
- [Examtopics az-104 dumps](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/az-104/) - it contains many questions (most of them were asked in the real exam). The answer listed in this site are not always correct, so refer the discussion tab for each answer to know more. This really helped me a lot in getting prepared.

So understanding the concept and ample amount of practice tests will boost your confidence. 

Best of Luck!
