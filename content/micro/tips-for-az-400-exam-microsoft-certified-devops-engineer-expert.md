I passed the [AZ-400 exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-400) today (18th Oct 2022) with a score of 920/1000. This exam is one of the new-role based Azure Certification that validates the skills of Azure DevOps Professionals. It qualifies you to work as Azure DevOps Engineers with recognition from Microsoft, who can design and implement strategies for collaboration, code, infrastructure, source control, security, compliance, continuous integration, testing, delivery, monitoring, and feedback.

I already had some experience with Azure and have recently [passed Azure Administrator Associate exam - AZ-104]({{< ref "/micro/tips-for-az-104-exam-microsoft-certified-azure-administrator-associate" >}}). Having hands on experience is better if you want to crack this exam.

It took me around a week to get fully prepared. I referred following resources for preparation:
- [Exam AZ-400 Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solution by Paul Furlan](https://www.oreilly.com/videos/exam-az-400-designing/9780137682577/) - It covers most of the syllabus for exam, explaining the concepts and focus areas.
- [Microsoft Official Practice Test powered by MeasureUp](https://www.measureup.com/microsoft-official-practice-test-az-400-designing-and-implementing-microsoft-devops-solutions.html) - it was free for me, since I have access to [Microsoft's Enterprise Skill Initiative portal](https://esi.microsoft.com/) from my employer.
- [Examtopics az-400 dumps](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/microsoft/az-400/) - it contains many questions (most of them were asked in the real exam). The answer listed in this site are not always correct, so refer the discussion tab for each answer to know more. This really helped me a lot in getting prepared.

So understanding the concept and ample amount of practice tests will boost your confidence. 

Best of Luck!
